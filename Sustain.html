        <p>
            The foundation of Tesla’s mission rests first and foremost on our products.
			Our focus from the beginning has been to develop products that are not
			only sustainable, but superior to fossil-fuel alternatives, as many believe
			that choosing sustainable products requires consumers to compromise
			on price or performance. Tesla’s all-electric vehicles combine performance,
			safety and efciency, making them the best cars in the world, while
			Tesla’s energy generation and storage products power both urban and
			remote communities with reliable, afordable energy.
        </p>
		<p>
			Transportation and electricity production are two of the largest sources
			of GHG emissions, making up more than half of all U.S. emissions.
			Tesla’s ecosystem (solar, batteries and vehicles) aims to reduce the
			environmental impacts of transportation, electricity production and
			energy use by people, homes, businesses and the grid.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2006, prior to the launch of the Tesla Roadster, there was no viable
			all-electric vehicle option on the market. Now, 12 years later, there are
			over 3M electric vehicles on the road globally, with more being produced
			every day. The auto industry is moving towards electrification, and
			governments around the world have recognized the harmful impact of
			internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle emissions and have started
			to take concrete steps towards making the future more environmentally
			friendly and sustainable.
