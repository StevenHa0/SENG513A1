    <h1>Tesla Model 3</h1>

        <div class="right-text">
            <p>
                With a near ideal blend of performance, driving range, and accessible 
                pricing, the 2022 Tesla Model 3 is an electric vehicle that lives up 
                to the hype. It's fast—especially the Performance trim—and it's agile, 
                which means the Model 3 is an EV that driving enthusiasts like us can 
                get behind. We even named it to our 2022 Editors' Choice list. Driving 
                range is an impressive 358 miles per charge on the mid-level Long Range 
                trim, so it's not necessary to charge the Model 3 every day. Its 
                attractive entry price doesn't unlock the Model 3's full potential, 
                though, and its fit and finish doesn't quite match alternatives such as 
                the Chevy Bolt and Ford Mustang Mach E. Still, there's not a more 
                inexpensive way to park one of Tesla's groundbreaking EVs in your driveway.
